## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In the hustle and bustle of today’s world, it is easy to lose track of household tasks. 
Chores, sporting events, bills, etc. can get lost in the shuffle. 
It would be amazing if there were an app where all of these can be tracked for a household. 
By having a system in which tasks or events can be assigned, tracked, and completed, a
household may find itself much more organized.

For our project, we would like to create a site where a user can enter household information, 
such as people/users, tasks to be completed, and even assign to a shared calendar. 
A household can be defined as people living together, so therefore, this can be applied to 
roommates or families.  

### Features
1. User authentication: users will need to create passwords and usernames to enter the site.
2.Adding household information: users will need to be able to add household names and tasks, like
chores, bills, etc.
3.filter/sort information: users will need to be able to insert and look through potential tasks 
to assign to various users.
4.Share to calendar: users can share tasks or events on shared calendars for easy knowledge outside 
of the site.

### Technologies
.net6
mySQL - to store user info for input tasks
### What I'll Have to Learn
Something that will be new to me is learning how to share/incorporate a calendar like google calendar 
or ical. This will require utilizing an API and figuring out how to code that piece of the application.
User authentication was something that I struggled with at the end of the c# course, so that would also 
be something I need to learn
